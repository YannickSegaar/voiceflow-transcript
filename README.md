# Voiceflow Transcript

A plugin to create Figma design elements directly from a Voiceflow transcript.

Pre-requisites:

- [Voiceflow Account](https://voiceflow.com)
- [Figma desktop app](https://figma.com/downloads/)

## Connecting your Voiceflow account

You'll need a Voiceflow API key and a Project ID to fetch transcript information. Information on how to create an API key is provided [here](https://developer.voiceflow.com/docs/step-1-get-api-key). Information on where your project ID is located can be found [here](https://learn.voiceflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/13619062205837-How-to-find-your-Assistant-version-ID-and-project-ID).

Transcripts can be created either using a specific transcript ID, or from a recent transcript:

- **Using a transcript ID** - browse to the transcript you would like to use; the transcript ID is the last part of the URL i.e. `https://creator.voiceflow.com/project/<ID>/transcripts/<TRANSCRIPT_ID>`

- **Recent transcript** - the dropdown shows some of the most recent transcripts from the project.
